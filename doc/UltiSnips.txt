DESCRIPTION                                           *UltiSnips-description*

UltiSnips aims to provide a snippets solution that users came to expect from
editors. A Snippet is a short piece of text which is either typed very often
or which contains a lot of redundant text. Such snippets are very often
encountered in structured text like Source Code but I also use them for email
signatures and to insert the current date or time into the text while typing.

UltiSnips is an implementation that is developed with in the philosophy of TDD
(Test driven development). This guarantees that features do not disappear and
bugs do not reappear after they have been fixed once.

2. INSTALLATION AND UPDATING                       *UltiSnips-installnupdate*


2.1 Installation                                     *UltiSnips-installation*
----------------

UltiSnips has only been tested on Mac OS X and Linux. Like TextMates Snippets
it also relies heavily on shell integration, therefore Windows users will have
only a part of the functionality. 

To use UltiSnips, you need a python enabled Vim 7. You have python if 
   :echo has("python")
yields '1'.

If you have Python, you only need to install UltiSnips. The recommended way to
do so is by using bzr (http://bazaar-vcs.org/). It is in all major linux
distribution (either package bzr or bazaar) and can be easily installed under
Mac OS X: >
   $ easy_install bzr

To get UltiSnips, check it out into a directory of your choice. Then add this
directory to your Vim runtime path: >
   $ cd ~/.vim/
   $ bzr get lp:ultisnips ultisnips_rep
   $ vim ~/.vimrc

add the line: >
   set runtimepath+=~/.vim/ultisnips_rep

Restart vim and UltiSnips should work. 

2.2 Deinstallation                                 *UltiSnips-deinstallation*
------------------

To Uninstall UltiSnips, remove the directory you installed it to and remove
the path from your vim runtimepath: >
   $ rm -rf ~/.vim/ultisnips_rep
   $ vim ~/.vimrc

remove the line: >
   set runtimepath+=~/.vim/ultisnips_rep

2.3 Updating                                             *UltiSnips-updating*
------------

To Update an installation, simply pull the latest revision: >
   $ cd ~/.vim/ultisnips_rep
   $ bzr pull

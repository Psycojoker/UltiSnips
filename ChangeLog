trunk:
  - Added support for b option. This only considers a snippet at the beginning
	 of a line ( *UltiSnips-adding-snippets* )
  - Added support for ! option. This overwrites previously defined snippets
    with the same tab trigger ( *UltiSnips-adding-snippets* )
  - Support for dotted filetype syntax. Now snippets for more than one filetype
    can be active ( *UltiSnips-adding-snippets* )
